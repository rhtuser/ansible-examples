## Ansible Examples

This Git repository contains a couple of branches that showcase some of the key principles in designing and developing playbooks and roles.

More information on the settings and ideas demonstrated is available in each branch.

The branches are:

* `standard-playbook` - a standard UNIX service (configurable via text files) deployment playbook
* `standard-role` - the same, but converted into a generic role
* `nonstandard-playbook` - a non-standard service (requiring the use of specific modules) deployment playbook
* `misc` - some of the demos that have not been classified yet, or are too small to have a branch of their own

Enjoy!
